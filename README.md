Advanced Filecoin and Multi-Blockchain Validator Infrastructure
Advanced Filecoin and Multi-Blockchain Validator Infrastructure

üåç Overview

This repository supports the development of a high-performance, decentralized storage infrastructure integrating Filecoin mining, optimized Proof-of-Spacetime (PoST) verification, and multi-blockchain validator nodes (Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos, Chainlink). By combining enterprise-grade hardware, AI-driven workload balancing, and automated monitoring, this project aims to enhance Filecoin's reliability, efficiency, and scalability.

This project is partially funded by the Filecoin Foundation Open Grants Program and adheres to MIT/Apache-2 dual-license open-source requirements.

üöÄ Project Goals

Enhance Filecoin's network efficiency through optimized zk-SNARK PoST verification.

Increase validator uptime with AI-driven monitoring and automated failover mechanisms.

Expand decentralized storage from 1 PiB to 5 PiB within 12 months.

Support multi-chain interoperability by integrating Filecoin with Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos, and Chainlink.

Ensure long-term sustainability through scalable power, networking, and storage solutions.
