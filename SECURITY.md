# 🔐 Security Policy for Money Machine

## 🛡️ Validator & Node Security Best Practices
To ensure the integrity, reliability, and security of validator nodes, follow these guidelines:

- **Use dedicated, isolated hardware** for validator operations.
- **Enable firewall rules** to restrict unauthorized access (e.g., only allow SSH from whitelisted IPs).
- **Regularly update and patch** validator software to protect against known vulnerabilities.
- **Monitor logs** using Prometheus & Grafana to detect unusual activity.
- **Use multi-signature wallets** for fund management & smart contract interactions.
- **Implement automated alerts** for potential slashing risks.

## 🛠️ Disaster Recovery & Risk Mitigation
Money Machine has multiple layers of redundancy to ensure **continuous uptime** and prevent validator slashing:

✅ **Power Redundancy:** Tesla Powerwall 3, UPS backup, and an automatic transfer switch (ATS).  
✅ **Internet Failover:** Google Fiber (primary), Starlink Business (secondary), and a dual-ISP failover router.  
✅ **Hardware Failover:** Redundant Lenovo servers, RAID storage configurations, and geographic failover sites.  
✅ **Automated Backups:** Daily encrypted snapshots of validator data stored securely.
